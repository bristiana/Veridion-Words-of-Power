### **Veridion Words of Power Challenge**
### **Can You Outsmart the System?**

Unleash the power of words in a high-stakes battle of strategy and wit!

This is a **text-based game** where **every word is a weapon** ‚Äî and **every move has a price**.

Some forces are defeated with strength, others with cunning, speed, or even resilience.

**Choose wisely**, because your goal isn‚Äôt just to survive ‚Äî it's to **spend the least** and **outsmart your opponent**.

### **üöÄ The Challenge**

A game where:

1. The system provides a **word each round** (e.g., *Tornado, Hammer, Pandemic*).
2. The player must **choose a word** from a **predefined list** that "beats" the system's word.
3. Every word the player picks has a **cost ($)** ‚Äî stronger words are more expensive.
4. If the player **fails to beat** the system‚Äôs word, they incur a **penalty**.
5. The game lasts **10 rounds**.
6. **Lowest total cost wins**, factoring in **win discounts** and **smart-play bonuses**!

---

## **üîç How the Game Works**

1. **System generates a word** (e.g., *Flood*).
2. **Player selects a word** from the predefined list (e.g., *Drought*).
3. **The game checks** if the player's word ‚Äúbeats‚Äù the system‚Äôs word:
    - ‚úÖ **Win**: Only the word‚Äôs cost is deducted.
    - ‚ùå **Loss**: The word‚Äôs cost + a penalty are deducted.
4. **Players play simultaneously** in each round.
5. **Repeat for 10 rounds**.
6. After 10 rounds, **final scores are calculated** with **special discounts and bonuses**.

## **üìú The Rules**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ The Words**

- **System words** are randomly chosen from a secret list.
- **Player words** come from a **fixed 77-word list**, each with an associated cost.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing a Word**

- Players can **only select from the predefined list**.
- Players **don‚Äôt know the system‚Äôs full word list**, so they must think strategically.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Winning & Losing a Round**

- A player‚Äôs word must **logically beat** the system‚Äôs word.
- If successful:
‚úÖ The **word‚Äôs cost is deducted**, and the round continues.
- If unsuccessful:
‚ùå A **penalty fee** is deducted in addition to the word‚Äôs cost.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Game End & Scoring**

- **5% Discount per Round Won**:
After 10 rounds, you receive **5% off your total bill** for every round you won.
(e.g., win 7 rounds ‚Üí 35% discount.)
- The **final score** = **total money spent** (cost of words + penalties).
- **Cheaper Win Bonus**:
If both players beat the system word, the **player who spent less** gets a **20% refund of their word's cost** for that round.
- **Final Score Formula**:

```python
Final Cost = ((Total Spent + 75 * Rounds Lost)  √ó (1 - (5% √ó Rounds Won))) - (Sum of Cheaper Win Refunds)
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏èPenalties**

If the player's word **does not beat** the system word, they receive a **flat** **penalty fee** of `75$` in addition to the cost of their chosen word.

**Example:**

- If the **system word is "Rock"**, and the player **chooses "Fire" (cost $22)**, the word **doesn‚Äôt beat Rock** ‚Üí they **spend $22 + incur a $75 penalty** = **$97 total spent**.

### **üß† Strategy Reminders**

- **Cheap words help save money**, but may fail against strong system words, leading to **penalties**.
- **Expensive words are powerful**, but using them too much will drain money fast.
- **Balance risk & cost** to finish with the lowest total spending!
